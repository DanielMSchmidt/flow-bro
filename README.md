## Usage

### Commands
#### `get-untyped <number>`

It gets you the most untyped components in the current directory.
Example: `flow-bro get-untyped 25`

It translates React PropTypes to Flow types in an opinionated way.
You will most likely need to adjust it later but it may be a good point to start.
